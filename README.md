- 👋 Hi, I’m Eno

- 🌱 I’m currently studying a MSc Cyber Security.  Some of the subjects I'm studying includes: Cyber Risk Management, Networking Security & Practices, Penetration Teasting, Security Automations and Digital Forensics.  I'm undertaking a team assignment where we have to analyse the GRC frameworks and cyber security Incidents of a fictional company and develop security solutions for it.

  I have over 3 years of experience within Cyber Security across GRC and Incident Response - conducting Information Security audits with compliance to ISO27001, PCI-DSS, NIST,   and GDPR as well as responding to information security incidents in conducting risk assessments of incidents and mitigations.

- 💞️ I’m also due to start a role as DevSecOps & Cyber Security Engineer and this profile will showcase some projects from my degree and other personal projects in DevSecOps.
